# Terraform This: Biogenesis
A simple mod that adds a decision to all uncolonized planets within your border, which starts a special project that adds a Terraforming Candidate modifier on completion. To unlock the decision, you have to research Biogenesis, a new technology after Climate Restoration.

No vanilla files or elements were overwritten, this mod adds only new stuff, so it should be compatible with pretty much everything.
