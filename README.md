# Terraform This: Biogenesis
This Stellaris mod adds a system to terraform barren and eventually even more hostile planets. Researching Biogenesis, a new technology after Climate Restoration, unlocks a decision on barren planets within your borders to fund a special project. Upon its completion, a Terraforming Candidate modifier is added to the planet. A follow-up tech, Terragenesis, similarly allows you to add Terraforming Candidate modifiers to hostile worlds (Toxic, Molten, Frozen, Broken, and Gas Giants), which then can be terraformed to barren planets.

While this drastically increases the potential habitable planets in the galaxy, the AI will only use this feature in systems that already have a colony. The decisions and new terraform links are also quite costly, making planet-spam difficult. Finally, the special projects require lots of research, bottlenecking the creation of Terraforming Candidates.
